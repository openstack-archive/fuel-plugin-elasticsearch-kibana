Introduction
============

The **StackLight Elasticsearch-Kibana Plugin** is used to install and configure
Elasticsearch and Kibana which collectively provide access to the logs and
notifications analytics of the so-called Logging, Monitoring and Alerting (LMA)
Toolchain of Mirantis OpenStack.
These analytics can be used to search and correlate service-affecting
events which occurred in your OpenStack environment. It is an indispensable
tool to troubleshooting problems.

Elasticsearch and Kibana are key components
of the `LMA Toolchain project <https://launchpad.net/lma-toolchain>`_
as shown in the figure below.
