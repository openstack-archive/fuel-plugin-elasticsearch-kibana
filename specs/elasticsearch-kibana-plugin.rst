===============================================
Fuel plugin to install Elasticsearch and Kibana
===============================================

https://blueprints.launchpad.net/fuel/+spec/elasticsearch-kibana-fuel-plugin

Elasticsearch [#]_ is an open source full-text search engine that allows
real-time search. This plugin will also provide Kibana [#]_, a flexible web
interface for exploring and visualizing the data stored in Elasticsearch.

Problem description
===================

A cloud operator needs a tool to easly search into a large amount of logs
and to visualize them in an efficient way. When an error or if the behavior of
our deployed environment is modified we want to be able to explore data to
investigate the problem.

Proposed changE
===============

We will provide a set of tools that will improve the way we can explore and
visualize data. To be useful this solution should be coupled to another one
that will feed the database of search engine. One candidate is the
Logging, Monitoring and Alerting collector [#]_ that is provided by the LMA
collector plugin.

Alternatives
------------

* It might have been implemented as part of Fuel core but we decided to make it
as a plugin for several reasons:

  - This isn't something that all operators may want to deploy.

  - Any new additional functionality makes the project's testing more difficult,
    which is an additional risk for the Fuel release.

  - Ideally, this effort may be of interest for non-Fuel based deployments, too.

* Search into the logs panel of the Fuel's dashboard.

* Log directly onto Fuel and use a grep like tool.

Performance Impact
------------------

The amount of resources (RAM, CPU, disk) required for ElasticSearch depends
on the number of clients but a typical setup would have at least 8GB of RAM
and fast disks (ideally SSD drives). As a consequence, it is highly recommended
to use a dedicated node for deploying the plugin. Good insights are given by
the Elasticsearch guide [#]_.

Other deployer impact
---------------------

To be useful the search engine needs to be feed. It can be achieved by other
Fuel plugins or an ad hoc solution
