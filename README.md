Elasticsearch-Kibana Plugin for Fuel
====================================

The **Elasticsearch-Kibana Fuel Plugin** is used to install and configure
Elasticsearch and Kibana which collectively provide access to the OpenStack
logs and notifications analytics.
Those analytics can be used to search and correlate the service-affecting
events which occurred in your OpenStack environment. It is an indispensable
tool to troubleshooting problems.
The Elasticsearch-Kibana Plugin is a key component of the
**Logging, Monitoring and Alerting (LMA) Toolchain** of Mirantis OpenStack.

Release Notes
-------------

**0.8.0**

* Add support for the "elasticsearch_kibana" Fuel Plugin role instead of
  of the "base-os" role which had several limitations.
* Add support for a retention policy configuration thanks to the integration
  of [Elastic Curator](https://github.com/elastic/curator)
* Upgrade to Elasticsearch 1.4.5

**0.7.0**

* Initial release of the plugin. This is a beta version.

Requirements
------------

| Requirement            | Version/Comment                             |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Fuel                   | Mirantis OpenStack 7.0 or higher            |
| Hardware configuration | The hardware configuration (RAM, CPU, disk) |
|                        | required by this plugin depends on the size |
|                        | of your cloud and other parameters like the |
|                        | log level being used, but a typical setup   |
|                        | would at least require a quad-core server   |
|                        | with 8GB of RAM and fast disks (ideally     |
|                        | SSDs). It is also highly recommended to use |
|                        | dedicated disk(s) for your data storage.    |
|                        | Otherwise, Elasticsearch will use the root  |
|                        | filesystem by default.                      |
